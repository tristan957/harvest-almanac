# Harvest Almanac

**Not endorsed by Harvest in any way shape or form**

If you have used Harvest in the past, you have probably used their Mobile, Mac,
and/or Windows clients. Unfortunately, Harvest does not provide a Linux client.

Harvest Almanac aims to be the client for Linux. It includes mobile support
for phones using [`libhandy`](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy).

This product is still largely in development, and is unusable at the moment.
Contributors are welcome to participate, however. Please refer to the
`CONTRIBUTING.md` if you are interested.
